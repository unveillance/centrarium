Welcome to our blog!  We are Unveillance.

The Unveillance software allows users to codify/ tag documents, images and videos sent to a dedicated server. Users can then build a database that can be searched using data-based questions. The search results can also be managed, reworked, and mashed-up to help the user explore broader and more complex issues.
